# 👨🏫 The Beauty of Mathematics

Let's assume our Pre-Launch on PinkSale goes smoothly and our Hard Cap is reached with the starting supply of 325,000 tokens at $15.00 each. With the effect of exponential compounding at the end of year (365 days); the Market Cap will go from $3,000,000 (3 Million) to $18,668,588,820! (18.6 Billion).

That is assuming the token price stays the same at initial market rate only. If we see high market demand from a lot of buyers, we could well see the market cap be a lot higher at EOY.&#x20;

Nevertheless the math gives us an extremely high probability of $TRUFFLE being in the Top 10.
