# 👨🏫 The Beauty of Mathematics

Let's assume our Pre-Launch on PinkSale goes smoothly and our soft cap is reached 20x = 1000 BNB

With the effect of exponential compounding at the end of year (365 days); the Market Cap will go from $1,111,111 (1,11 Million) to $ **9,178,807,247.73!** (over 9 Billion).

That is assuming the token price stays the same at initial market rate only. If we see high market demand from a lot of buyers, we could well see the market cap be a lot higher at EOY.&#x20;

Nevertheless the math gives us an extremely high probability of $TRUFFLE being in the Top 10.
