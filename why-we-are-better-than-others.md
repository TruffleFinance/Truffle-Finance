# 🏆 Why We Are Better Than Others

![](<.gitbook/assets/final 1.jpg>)

## The Highest APY💰&#x20;

&#x20;<mark style="color:green;">**980,990,50% Fixed APY**</mark>

## The Fastest Rebase🏃‍♀️&#x20;

Rewarded <mark style="color:green;">**EVERY 3 SECONDS**</mark>\
Gives 2.5% daily (<mark style="color:green;">**980,990,50%**</mark>** APY**, 0.0000858% per block)\
Other projects give reward in every 15 or 30 minutes or more due to their limitation.\
People have to wait that next 15 or 30 minute period to get next reward before doing something.\
Our project divides reward into smaller portions and give reward every 3 seconds.\
You cannot miss or wait any reward as <mark style="color:green;">**this is theoretical maximum speed in BSC**</mark>\
by combining with the APY, it gives higher reward than any other projects.

## More Safe🔒&#x20;

Others use <mark style="color:green;">**EOA wallet**</mark> for burn.\
No one knows they have key to control that wallet or not.

They can sell big amount of tokens or pull big amount of liquidity <mark style="color:green;">**ANYTIME**</mark>.

\
We have been consistently pointed out that this is a big security issue.\
Our burn address is a <mark style="color:green;">**verifiable**</mark> contract which has no owner.

## More Stable

We have same manual buyback like others.

But we also have <mark style="color:green;">**auto-buyback**</mark> for each sell

## More Healthy

Others have <mark style="color:green;">**big price drop**</mark> when adding LP.\
<mark style="color:green;">**We do not.**</mark>

## More Consistent👌&#x20;

Unlike others, we have fixed exponential decay of interest rate change at each year. \
meaning we have fixed rate for 1 year and changes every each year.

## More Sustainable💪&#x20;

<mark style="color:green;">**Others have price drop**</mark> at each rebase. \
We have not. We have a special algorithm to avoid this
