# üè¶ The Treasury

The Treasury plays a very important role in **Truffle Finance Auto-Staking Protocol.** It provides three extremely critical functions for the growth and sustainability of $TRUFFLE.&#x20;

The treasury functions as additional financial support for the RIF. This additional support can become important in the event of an extreme price drop of the $TRUFFLE token or unforeseen black-swan event. It helps to establish a floor value for the $TRUFFLE token.&#x20;

The treasury may also be used to fund new Truffle Finance products, services, and projects that will expand and provide more value to the TRUFFLE community aswell as providing funding for marketing.
