# ðŸ”¥ Truffle Flame

<mark style="color:green;">**2.5%**</mark> of all $TRUFFLE traded are burnt in **The Truffle Flame**. The more that is traded, the more get put into the fire causing the truffle flame  to grow in size, larger and larger through self fulfilling Auto-Compounding, reducing the circulating supply and keeping the truffle finance stable.

The other benefit to an everlasting burn of circulating supply is that due to the deflationary nature of it, equates to a higher value of each $TRUFFLE token, therefore increasing the individual value.
