Truffle Finance has integrated a solid RIF structure which takes advantage of the trading volume fees in order to back the staking rewards (rebase rewards) when the TRUFFLE/BNB pair supply is worth 2.5% of the total supply.

When the daily RIF gains are greater than or equal to all the Holders Daily ROI, this means that the Swap Threshold can fill the plus-value generated from the Rebase Rewards.
