# âš™ How Does Auto-Staking Work?

The WFAP Auto-Stake feature is a simple yet cutting-edge function called **Buy-Hold-Earn**, that provides the ultimate ease of use for $TRUFFLE holders.

**Buy-Hold-Earn** - By simply buying and holding $TRUFFLE token in your wallet, you earn rebase rewards as interest payments directly into your wallet. Your tokens will increase <mark style="color:green;"><mark style="color:green;">**every**<mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">** **</mark><mark style="color:green;">**3 seconds**</mark><mark style="color:green;"><mark style="color:green;">.<mark style="color:green;"></mark>

Using a Positive Rebase formula, Truffle makes it possible for token distribution to be paid directly proportional to the epoch rebase rewards, worth 0.0000858% / 3 seconds epoch period of the total amount of $TRUFFLE tokens held in your wallet. The rebase rewards are distributed on each EPOCH (3 seconds rebase period) to all $TRUFFLE holders.

**This means that without moving their tokens from their wallet, Truffle holders receive an annual compound interest of **<mark style="color:green;">**980,990,50%**</mark>** for Year 1.**

**The interest rebase rate then reduces after the first 12 months.**
