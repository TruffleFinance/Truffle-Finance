# ðŸª™ TRUFFLE Token

$TRUFFLE is a Bep20 token which rewards its holders with automatic passive interest payments every 8 minutes over the lifespan of 13.5 years until the maximum supply of 3.25 Billion tokens has been reached.

**Is Truffle just another Titano Fork?**

Our entire protocol's smart contract was written and developed from scratch from our own competent group of developers. It does not contain any resemblance to Titano's code or operation as Truffle works on a completely new set of mechanics which allows for complete protocol sustainability.

We also have several proprietary mechanisms in place that we have created ourselves which offers many improvements over our competition such as; our Truffle Auto-Liquidity Engine (SALE), the Truffle Insurance Fund (TIF), our Longterm Interest Cycle (LIC), aswell as safeguards in place which secure against malicious hack attempts.

Truffle's tokenomics are also completely unique with our Auto-Burn Truffle Flame structure, minimal starting supply and lower 8 minute Epoch's for a much more linear APY progression of attainability.
