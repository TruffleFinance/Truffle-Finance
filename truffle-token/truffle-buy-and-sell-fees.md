# ðŸ“Ž Truffle Buy and Sell Fees

**Truffle buy and sell fees are an important component of the SAP**. They provide capital for performing critical functions to the protocol.

Other protocols utilize selling bonds to support the same functions as Truffle fees, but we believe that approach is riskier because if bonds are not purchased, the token can lose its support and spiral downward in price as we have seen with several of these bond based protocols.

Selling bonds also costs token holders. It reduces the amount of APY that can be offered and eliminates the ability to offer a stable APY.

The amount of the fees (<mark style="color:green;">**14% for buys**</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">**16% for sells**</mark>) allows Truffle to provide $TRUFFLE holders with the stable high yield of 396,235.4% annually.
