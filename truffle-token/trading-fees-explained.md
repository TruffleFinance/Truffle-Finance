* **LP -** Trading fees goes to backing the liquidity of the BNB/TRUFFLE pair on PancakeSwap ensuring an ever-increasing collateral value of $TRUFFLE. &#x20;
* **TIF -** Trading fees are stored in the Truffle Insurance Fund which helps sustain and back the staking rewards provided by the positive rebase.
* **Truffle Treasury -** Trading fees go directly to the Truffle Treasury which supports the TIF and provides a marketing budget for Truffle and funds new product development.
* **Truffle Flame -** 2.5% of all $TRUFFLE traded are burnt in the Truffle Flame. The more that is traded, the more get put into the fire causing the Truffle Flame to grow in size, larger and larger through self fulfilling auto-compounding which in return acts to reduce the circulating supply of $TRUFFLE and keeping the Truffle Finance stable.
