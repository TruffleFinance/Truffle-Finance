# ðŸ’² Longterm Interest Cycle (LIC)

In order to maintain sustainability and future growth, we have introduced a Longterm Interest Mechanism (LIM) component which will award $TRUFFLE token holders with continued compound interest in perpetuity.

Each Interest Cycle is seconds in length and is referred to as an **EPOCH**.&#x20;

There are 10,512,000 EPOCH's in 1 year.



**EPOCH 1 - 10,512,000:** 0.0000858% every EPOCH **(First 12 Months)**

**EPOCH 10,512,001- 21,024,000:** 0.00000858% every EPOCH **(Next 6 months)**

**EPOCH 21,024,001 - 31,536,000:** 0.000000858% every EPOCH **(Next 6.5 Years)**

**And so on until max supply is reached after 12 years.**

Initial supply is 10,000,000 and max supply is 100,000,000,000
