# ðŸ’² Longterm Interest Cycle (LIC)

In order to maintain sustainability and future growth, we have introduced a Longterm Interest Cycle (LIC) component which will award $TRUFFLE token holders with continued compound interest in perpetuity.

Each Interest Cycle is 8 minutes in length and is referred to as an **EPOCH**.&#x20;

There are 35,040 EPOCH's in 1 year.



**EPOCH 1 - 35,040:** 0.02355% every EPOCH **(First 12 Months)**

**EPOCH 35,041 - 52,560:** 0.00211% every EPOCH **(Next 6 months)**

**EPOCH 52,561 - 245,280:** 0.00014% every EPOCH **(Next 6.5 Years)**

**EPOCH 245,281:** 0.00002% every EPOCH **(In Perpetuity until max supply is reached)**
