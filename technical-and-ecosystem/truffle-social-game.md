# üèô TRUFFLE Social Game

NFT Owners use their own NFT as a citizen to play Truffle Social Game

The TRUFFLE Social is a virtual miniature society that is comprised of "Business" and "Citizen". Each is rich in its characteristics, and waiting to be explored.&#x20;

Business: Similar to the real Truffle , Businesses are the most important and valuable resources in the TRUFFLE Social. Issued as non-fungible tokens (NFT), Businesses can be owned through the bidding method.

Citizen: Each NFT in TRUFFLE NFT Collection is shown as a Citizen. NFT will be minted using $TRUFFLE , a part will be airdropped in special events. The duties of citizens are divided as follows:

* Immortal: in charge as Manager of Tier 1 Businesses: Bank, Investment Fund, Corporation
* Epic: in charge as Manager of Tier 2 Businesses: V.I.P Club, Art Gallery, Movie Theater
* Rare: in charge as Manager of Tier 3 Businesses: Restaurant, Coffee Shop, Super Market
* Common: in charge as Employee of Businesses

Players who haven't owned NFT can join TRUFFLE Social as Guests.

In TRUFFLE  Social, We sell Banner Ads, and work with KOL to create events such as Livestream, AMA, to attract more Guests to come. The revenue stream will be shared to the Business Owners, the Managers, and pay Salary for Employees. The higher Tier of Business, the more share from the Revenue Stream.
