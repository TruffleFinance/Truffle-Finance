# ðŸ›¡ Truffle Insurance Fund (TIF)

**TIF** is the acronym for the Truffle Insurance Fund which is a separate wallet in Truffle's **SAP** system. The TIF uses an algorithm that backs the Rebase Rewards and is supported by a portion of the buy and sell trading fees that accrue in the TIF wallet. &#x20;

In simple terms, the staking rewards (rebase rewards) which are distributed every 8 minutes at a rate of **0.0095%** are backed by the TIF parameter, thus ensuring a high and stable interest rate to $TRUFFLE token holders.&#x20;

5% of all trading fees are stored in the Truffle Insurance Fund which helps sustain and back the staking rewards provided by the positive rebase.

### TIF Keeps holders safe by:

* Avoiding flash crash through price stability
* Achieving longterm sustainability and future growth of the Truffle Finance
* Greatly reducing downside risk
